Sexual offenses can be confusing to discuss because of the uncomfortable nature ofthe topic, and because their classifications can be confusing. Sexual harassment and assault are serious issues in any community, but what some people may not know is that they are not both classified as crimes.
<br><Br>
A commonly used definition of sexual assault is “illegal sexual contact that usually involves force upon a person without consent or is inflicted upon a person who is incapable of giving consent (as because of age or physical or mental incapacity) or who places the assailant (as a doctor) in a position of trust or authority,” (http://www.merriamwebster.com/dictionary/sexual%20assault).
<br><Br>
Sexual harassment, on the other hand, is defined as such: “uninvited and unwelcome verbal or physical behavior of a sexual nature especially by a person in authority toward a subordinate (as an employee or student),” (http://www.merriamwebster.com/dictionary/sexual%20harassment).In other words, sexual harassment, while unwanted, is not illegal.
<br><br>
Of course sexual harassment and assault also have definitions pertaining to the online and mobile world; these are crimes like cyberstalking, child pornography, sexting, because many varieties of online crime are relatively new, many of them are not classified by governmental bodies as normal crimes would be.  For instance, physical sexual assault and harassment are under the very broad umbrella of “sexual offenses,” rather than 
being separated, though they are later categorized in the sentencing phase.
<br><Br>
Cyber sex offenses are classified the exact same way: very broadly, as sexual offenses.Sentences for cyber sex offenses – and physical sex offenses – are not always the same for each crime: the sentence is determined by the severity of the crime and the record of the accused, like every other case.
<br><Br>
Sentences for cyber offenses may change in the future as they become as standard, and possibly as frequent, as physical offenses of the same kind – and they might be well on their way to normalcy already.
<br><br>
Sexual offenses are not new crimes in Kent, and many students will say cyber sexual offenses are not new either, but what is new is how incidents of sexual crimes are being reported on and off campuses across the US.
<br><Br>
Incidents of sexual assault (physical and cyber) have increased in the past few years, but it may not be that more of the incidents are occurring, simply that more are being reported.Organizations and celebrities have taken to the airwaves and social media with intensified zeal in the recent past, trying to spread awareness about sexual violence, and encouraging victims to report instances of these crimes without hesitation.
<br><Br>
One might assume that these outreach efforts coupled with heightened security has also had a positive effect on making the number of reported incidents come closer to the number of crimes that have actually occurred.Although every city police department and campus police department is different, the reporting procedures for these crimes, physical or cyber, tend to be similar.
<br><Br>
Officer Penn of the Kent State University Police Department says to report an instance of sexual assault, cyber or otherwise, all one has to do is call the police station.  
<br><Br>
Information about the incident can be reported over the phone, although Penn recommends giving a statement in person.  According to Penn, an officer can be dispatched to the location of the caller to take the statement, or the caller can come to the station.  
<br><br>
Penn also advises that incidents be reported as quickly as possible in order to collect as much evidence as possible, and so that the statement can be taken while details are still easily remembered.

Should I quote the definitions by saying which dictionary they came from or  by citing the website?  Or rather, is it enough to have an in-text citation or 

not?

 Sexual harassment: uninvited and unwelcome verbal or 

physical behavior of a sexual nature especially by a person in

o Should I include more definitions?

o Should I take them from the Ohio Department of Justice, compare definitions, 

etc.?

o Can we do stories that are somewhat editorial style?

o Should I include the “stats” (number of reports) from Kent PD and KSU PD?
