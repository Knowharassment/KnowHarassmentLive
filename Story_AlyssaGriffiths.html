<p> 
Kent State senior Allyssa Griffiths has experienced multiple instances of cyberstalking, both before and during her time at school. 
<br><br>
From vulgar texts and pictures to misuse of her personal information and catfishing, she’s managed to turn her misfortune into a learning opportunity for students at Kent.
<br><br>
Throughout her talk, “Catfish, Cyberstalking and Social Media,” she details her long and difficult experience with cyberharassment.
<br><br>
“I used Facebook and social media how everybody else uses those things,” Griffiths told students at her most recent lecture.  “I didn’t realize that by putting up these pictures and sharing my information that for five years I was somebody I don’t know access to my life.”
<br><br>
It began the summer before her freshman year at Kent State with Griffiths receiving disturbing texts that were sexual in nature. One was a photo of a nude man from the neck down.
<br><br>
Griffiths’ harasser quickly made her feel uncomfortable with aggressive and vulgar texts saying they were Allyssa’s “secret crush” and asking her personal questions and making provocative comments.
<br><br>
What really alarmed Griffiths, though, was something very simple: The way the harasser spelled her name.  Griffiths spells her name “Allyssa,” a very specific spelling, and a spelling her harasser knew.  
<br><br>
“My grandmother still doesn’t spell my name right,” Griffiths says jokingly.
<br><br>
When Griffiths threatened to go to the police, her harasser quickly apologized and said they wouldn’t bother her again.
<br><br>
“And that was that,” Griffiths says. 
<br><br>
She says she saved the phone number in her cell phone as “Creep,” so that if she was ever contacted again, she would know it was the same person.
<br><br>
Months later, it was finals week of her first freshman semester, and she realized someone named “Lauren Ashley Cook” was using images and facts mined from her personal social media accounts as their own material.
<br><br>
The scope of this identity theft shocked Griffiths. As well as using Griffiths’ images for multiple social media profiles and blogs (more than 20 in total), her harasser created a group of imaginary friends—friends who closely resembled Griffiths’ friends. Save for a few carefully changed names, Cook’s friends seemed to have the exact same conversations and photos as Griffiths’.
<br><br>
“It was obvious this person had put a lot of time and effort into these websites,” Griffiths says, noting that many of the mined details had come from her Myspace account, which had been deleted years earlier.
<br><br>
Going further, Cook had repurposed many of Griffiths’ photos.  Where Griffiths had posted a picture of her and a male friend, Cook used the same photo and claimed it was of her and her dead brother.  
<br><br>
References to drugs, alcohol and other illegal activities were also referenced alongside Griffiths’ misused pictures.
<br><br>
Griffiths’ harasser had invaded her online life on a personal level, but the consequences spilled over into the real world: The real Allyssa Griffiths had to prove she was the person in the pictures, as some of Cook’s online friends didn’t realize who the real victim was.
<br><br>
“Cook” had created a completely false identity, but it was more than convincing her followers and friends online.
<br><br>
Griffiths messaged one of Cook’s closest friends, Mike, and after sending proof and convincing him she was who she said she was, enlisted him in finding out more information about her impostor.
<br><br>
What Mike told Griffiths about Cook jolted her.  Every fact about Cook was straight from Griffiths’ life. Cook had appropriated Griffiths’ entire life and made it her own. From where she went to high school and college to her places of employment to her likes, interests, family pets and siblings—it was Griffiths’ life to the detail.
<br><br>
“He just started rattling off facts about my life,” Griffiths said.  “This person had been feeding him information about me.”
<br><br>
When Mike gave her the impostor’s number, Griffiths was shocked at what came up.  Rather than appearing as simply a phone number or “Lauren Cook,” Griffiths’ phone knew this number: it was “Creep.”
<br><br>
The very same person who had harassed Griffiths over the summer was impersonating her online.
<br><br>
When Griffiths tried to report this abuse and explain that someone had created an entire life and personality online with her information, adults around her and the police told Griffiths that it was her fault her information was misused and that to solve the problem, she should simply stop using social media.
<br><br>
Acting as if the incident was nothing concerning, one police officer even said Griffiths was “giving him a headache.”
<br><br>
“I didn’t feel like they were on my side,” Griffiths says. 
<br><br>
She says she felt disappointed and alone, as if she were the only one who could or would fix the problem.
<br><br>
So rather than taking their advice, Griffiths decided to take action by texting Cook.
<br><br>
“You know who I am.  I know who you are.  Let’s just please stop.  Please take down the websites.  I don’t know why you’re doing this, I don’t know why you chose me, but please leave me alone, leave my friends alone, and just take them down.”
<br><br>
Though Cook agreed to take down the websites, she did not—she only changed her identity.  Griffiths says her impostor had been everything from a 16-year-old girl to a single mom, just never really herself.
<br><br>
“She told me that she had found me on Myspace when I was 14, that I had the perfect life, and that’s the reason why she was doing this,” Griffiths says, but that’s the only explanation she’s ever gotten.
<br><br>
Griffiths now speaks about using social media as a tool and source of power for networking and maintaining a unique identity. Griffiths says there are three ways of ensuring your identity is protected on social media:
be aware of who is looking at and posting on your sites, social media or otherwise;
filter everything by making your posts representative of who you are and where you want to go in life, not about the guy who cut you off on the highway, and;
be in control by making sure your online presence is positive and you’re not posting comments or pictures you’ll have to take down later.
<br><br>
These days, Griffiths takes her own advice when using social media and truly believes her system works.
<br><br>
“It works because it forces me to consciously think and make decisions every single day,” Griffiths says. “I no longer tweet out of impulse. I no longer post things without thoroughly thinking it through, and I think that because of that system I have really been able to create a positive online presence because everything that I put out I believe is a real reflection of me and where I want to go.”
<br><br>
Griffiths credits her use of social media as the primary reason she got a prestigious internship, and on top of that, a great job. Griffiths says she is happy she didn’t listen to the adults and police at the time, and pursued an active social media presence.
<br><br>
Of Griffiths’ harasser, she says,“she continued to make websites, she continued to make blogs.  I wish I had some kind of really cool ending where, you know, she got punished for what she did, or there was some kind of law […] but there’s not.”
<br><br>
She advises anyone with a social media account to, above all, exercise control. 
<br><br>
“It just goes back to control: how do you want to control it?”
<br><br>
Griffiths recommends thinking about whether you want to make your social media accounts public or private, to think about what you post and to think about your audience and whether your online friends are people you can trust.
