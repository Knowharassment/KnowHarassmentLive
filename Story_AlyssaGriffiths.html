KSU senior Allyssa Griffith has experienced multiple instances of cyberstalking before and during her time at Kent State.  From vulgar texts and pictures to misuse of her personal information and catfishing, she’s managed to turn her misfortune into a learning opportunity for students at Kent.
<br><br>
Throughout her talk in 137 Bowman Hall Wednesday, she detailed her long and difficult experience with cyberharassment.
<br><br>
It began the summer before her freshman year at KSU with Griffith receiving disturbing texts that were sexual in nature, and a photo of a nude man from the neck down.  When she threatened to go to the police, her harasser apologized and said they wouldn’t bother her again.  She saved the phone number in her cell phone as “creep,” so that if she was ever contacted again, she would know it was the same person.
<br><Br>
Months later, well into her freshman year, she realized someone was using images and facts mined from her personal social media accounts as their own material.  As well as using these images for blogs and social media profiles, Griffith’s harasser was invading her life on a personal level: people who met Griffith believed that she was impersonating her harasser, not realizing who the real victim was.
<br><Br>
What’s more, adults around her and the police told Griffith that it was her fault her information was misused, and that to solve the problem, she should simply stop using social media.Rather than taking their advice. Griffith decided to take action, and she decided to do it via social media.
<br><Br>
She now speaks about using social media as a tool, as a source of power for networking and maintaining a unique identity. 
<br><br>
        
<div id="subhead">Griffith says there are three ways of ensuring your identity is protected on social media:</div>
<br>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Be aware of who is looking at your site, and who is posting on it.</li>

        <li>Filter everything – make your posts representative of who you are and where you want to go in life, not about the guy who cut you off on the highway.
        </li>
        
        <li>Be in control – make sure your online presence is positive, and you’re not posting comments or pictures you’ll have to take down later.
        </li>

        <li>Griffith now credits her use of social media with getting her a prestigious internship and a job to boot.  
        </li>
        </ol>

    <p>Griffith is happy that she didn’t listen to the adults and police at the time, and pursued an active social media presence.
