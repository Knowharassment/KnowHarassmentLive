    <p>

Even if you’ve never heard the term “cyberharassment,” you’ve likely heard of it.  It’s harassment, but with a tech twist.  If it’s unwanted communication, and it’s on a mobile device, computer or tablet, it’s cyberharassment.
<br><Br>
If you’re reading this, chances are you’ve basically grown up on a computer. When you grow up with something, you tend to look past certain aspects of it.  We overlook the problems and difficulties because we value convenience.
<br><Br>
Online technology is the perfect example.  The World Wide Web – and emergent computer technology that’s followed it – has become one of our greatest conveniences.  We love it, but we’re realizing more every day that our reliance has made us very vulnerable.
<br><Br>
Everywhere we look, a new tech threat emerges: cyberterrorism is a very real possibility; online commerce, though expedient and popular, puts many people in danger of becoming victims of fraud; government secrets are leaked and hacked regularly; and various types of black markets and trafficking exist in this world – the world that occupies no physical space.
<br><Br>
But there’s one more social danger that we have to wrestle with if we’re going to exist with this social technology: cyberharassment.  Even though harassment is nothing new, the modern iteration is just as insidious, just as emotionally complicated, and possibly just as under-reported.
<br><Br>
Awareness about cyberharassment is spreading, and one of the most recent sites created for the purpose of raising awareness is one that my group in a web programming course  created called KnowHarassment has begun building. [THIS MIGHT NOT BE THE SITE NAME?]  Those of us who produced this site are conducting a survey about cyberharassment, and in much the same way regular harassment is underreported, survey data from KnowHarassment has found that cyberharassment is also reported in a very minimal way, if at all.
<br><Br>
And just because an advance – cyber or physical – is unwanted, doesn’t mean some people won’t try to get away with doing it.  Interestingly enough, the new version seems to have the same root causes as its old form according to a Refinery 29 article by Elizabeth Segran about why men send “dick pics.” 
<br><Br>
First of all, some online harassers are well aware that their behavior is unwanted, but it has the potential to produce reciprocation or even just a reaction, which is really what they’re looking for.  It doesn’t matter if the reaction is positive because the participation elicited gives them a sense of power.
<br><Br>
Another reason an online relationship might become one involving harassment is that some people are confused about the nature of their relationship.  According to Refinery 29, due to different socialization patterns, men especially enjoy getting nude photos, and think their counterpart will too.  That, paired with the idea that the culture of pornography has become intertwined with technology culture means that communication likely takes place on the same device on which porn is watched.
<br><Br>
The Refinery 29 article points to one more reason some people engage in behavior your average person might find offensive: no matter how strange, provocative, vulgar or  repellent it is, some people dig that stuff.  Simple as that.
<br><Br>
The general rule of thumb: if you’re already wondering if whether you’re sending something offensive, then you probably are – so don’t.
<br><Br>        
Some general things not to do:
- Even though technology seems to satisfy our need for immediacy, don’t expect a response from someone right away.  If it takes a while for someone to get back to you, the world won’t end, I swear.
<br><br>
- A good general rule is not to use coarse or vulgar language in public online places (someone’s Facebook wall, or in a tweet, for example), especially if you’re not too 
familiar with the person you’re talking to.
<br><br>
- Especially avoid vulgar language when discussing difficult or sensitive topics.
<br><br>
- Don’t call, text, email or otherwise communicate with someone who is obviously trying to avoid you.
<br><Br>
- No one should have to tell you this, but don’t contact friends or family members of someone who is trying to avoid you.
<br><Br>
Some general things you should do to make yourself safer online:
<br><Br>
- Avoid friending or communicating with anyone you don’t know directly;
<br><br>
-Avoid meeting anyone you’ve met online without someone you trust being present;
<br><br>
-Change your passwords regularly;
<br><Br>
- Keep a log of any calls, texts, emails or other communications you think are suspicious or concerning;
<br><Br>
- Encourage friends and family who may be experiencing harassment to report it immediately.
<br><Br>
And remember, there’s no harm in asking someone what they like or want.  Everyone’s weird and normal in their own way, so make a friend rather than offending a stranger.
<br><Br>
Note the lack of gender-specific pronouns: this is not an accident.  As far as the numbers go, many stats say women are disproportionally affected by sexual harassment, but this site is not about male-bashing, it’s about awareness.  So don’t forget, harassment goes both ways.
<br><Br>
And please keep an eye out for our KnowHarassment site (it will be up and running soon), and until then please take our survey at https://kent.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_d4gv0yUcOupwCyx or visit us at https://www.facebook.com/KnowHarassment.  We appreciate any site traffic, survey respondents and feedback you can give us.  Every tiny piece of information helps us immensely, and means spreading awareness, and that’s our goal.
