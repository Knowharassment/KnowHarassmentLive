Tiffeny Townsend, a server at a restaurant in Kent, is like any other 20-something.  She uses Facebook as the social media connector that it is, writing posts about life, keeping in touch with friends and family, and posting pictures.  Nothing out of the ordinary.
<br><Br>
“I’m a normal, average girl, and I guess that was what made it believable,” says Townsend of her online impersonator.
<br><br>
One day about three months ago, Townsend noticed a profile that wasn’t hers had a profile picture that was hers.
<br><Br>
“As I went into my notifications to click on it,” said Townsend, “right in front of me, her profile picture changed to my picture.” 
<br><Br>
The name on the profile was Sammi Geronimo, a name she didn’t recognize.
<br><Br>
After taking a screenshot of the notification, she messaged Geronimo to ask her to take the picture down, but Geronimo’s response was to block Townsend and all of her Facebook friends.
<br><Br>
Townsend used every method she knew to take care of the situation on her own.
<br><Br>
“[I] tried to report her, tried to block her, commented on the photos,” said Townsend.  “Immediately she would delete the comments, that I would post or that my friends would post.”
<br><Br>
It was clear that Geronimo knew the photos she was using were not her own, and knew how important it was that she keep Townsend’s online presence away from her own to maintain her fake profile.
<br><Br>
“I started asking all of my friends and family to please report this girl, message her, tell her to take my photos down – it’s not her,” said Townsend.  “I didn’t want my photos to be stolen or used in case, you know, she could’ve been a pedophile, she could’ve been anything.”
<br><br>
Townsend even tried to contact Geronimo through her mother’s Facebook account, but since everyone Townsend knew was blocked, communicating with her impostor was next to impossible.
<br><Br>
Finally, in an effort to put the situation to rest for good, Townsend tried reporting Geronimo to Facebook, but there was just one problem: Geronimo had already reported Townsend.
<Br><Br>
Townsend then got a message from Facebook accusing her of being the impostor, even though she had begun uploading photos in 2009, years before Geronimo had created her profile.
<Br><Br>
Townsend can still use her Facebook page, but unfortunately she cannot see any of Geronimo’s information and believes she is out of options until Geronimo does something illegal with her pictures.
<br><Br>
Though Townsend’s ordeal hasn’t been resolved, she encourages social media users to be active in helping to report any instances of fraudulent behavior or cyberharassment they might be aware of.
