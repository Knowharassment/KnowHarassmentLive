        <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
    
		<p>KnowHarassment  provides an accurate representation of the prevalence of sexual harassment and cyberharassment within a student body by providing survey data from Kent State students. We report on the ways cyberharassment differs from other sex crimes in terms of method, impact and legal stance. We hope to empower students to shut it down by outlining how to recognize, properly handle and report it to law enforcement.</p></div>

            <h2>A Little About Us</h2>
    
		<p>A national spotlight is shining on college campus sex crimes for the first time, especially those involving physical contact. We already know sexual assaults are grossly underreported for many reasons, but we have even less knowledge about the non-physical, but often just as damaging sexual harassment offenses affecting college students every day.</p>
            <p></p>
And now sexual harassment has a new home: online. Cyberharassment is harassment in the form of emails, text messages, social media messages or any other form of electronic communication.
</p><p>
Sexual harassment is not a criminal offense, but cyberharassment is, often referred to as telecommunications harassment in statutory law. 
              </p><p>
Little data has been collected that reflects the prevalence of cyberharassment on college campuses other than reports made to university police departments, which is why we decided to ask the students ourselves with a survey intended to gather data about the prevalence of sex crimes, particularly cyberharassment, among Kent State students.
                  </p><p>
We have also gathered data showing the number of telecommunications harassment reports from other comparable public universities in Ohio. We have interviewed sexual violence experts, counselors and victims. We have talked to law-enforcement agencies and Title IX coordinators.
                      </p><p>
Our goal is to track sexual harassment and cyberharassment prevalence among the Kent State student body, share stories of victims and inform students about how they can prevent harassment and put an end to it.
</p><p>
By asking students about their experience with sexual and cyberharassment directly, we hope to bring attention to a truly reflective representation of its presence among college students and empower those affected to recognize it and shut it down.</p>
