Many people have experienced cyberharassmemt, but McKenzie Doolittle, a freshman at Kent State, has experienced it twice.
<br><Br>
Both times, Doolittle was harassed by an ex-boyfriend, was verbally abused, threatened with physical harm and felt unsure of what she should do to make it stop.
<br><Br>
In the first instance, Doolittle says she was in her junior year of high school, trying to prepare for senior year and college while managing a very stressful family life.  She had been dating a boy at her school a year younger than her, but after three months, chose to end the relationship to focus on school and family.
<br><Br>
“But when I explained that to him, he blew up my phone, blew up my Facebook, everything,” Doolittle says. “And he went to my friends and said that he was going to kill himself, said that there must be someone else, that it must have been my mom making me do it, and then he went around telling everyone in my high school that I was a whore.”
<br><Br>
Doolittle says she believes her ex’s existing emotional issues paired with the breakup were too much for him to handle and he began harassing her. She never thought he would act in such an extreme way, but aside from sending her frequent and threatening text messages and spreading rumors about her at school, he physically stalked her and threatened her with physical harm.
<br><br>
“It got to the point where I was even scared to go to my classes because he was waiting right behind my bus stop, and he was stalking me in between classes so I had my guy friends walk me there.  I didn’t eat lunch at school, I just sat in a teacher’s classroom,” she says.
<br><Br>
Doolittle asked her harasser to stop via text and in person, but soon realized he didn’t plan on stopping.  The frequency, content of the messages and unwillingness to resolve the issue all worried Doolittle.  She almost contacted the police, but, instead, she got her school involved.
<br><Br>
The final semester of Doolittle’s junior year was made more difficult by being put in a class with her harasser. Doolittle had gone to her assistant principal when the harassment began in November, but when a new assistant principal started at her school in the spring, somehow the message about Doolittle’s harassment and need to stay away from her harasser had not been relayed.
<br><Br>
Doolittle’s first experience with harassment finally ended, but only after Kyle, a large, male friend of hers, threatened her harasser in person.
<br><Br>
“’I’m tired of seeing her cry,’” Doolittle quotes her friend as saying.  “’If I ever hear her name come out of your mouth, I will beat the s*** out of you.’”
<br><Br>
Doolittle’s second instance with cyberharassment didn’t last as long, but she says it was just as frightening. After ending a three-month relationship amicably, Doolittle received a Facebook message from an ex.
<br><Br>
During her senior year, a friend of Doolittle’s had started dating her ex, then broke up with him.  Doolittle’s friend has started posting unflattering Facebook posts about Doolittle’s ex, but he was not appreciative or amused.
<br><Br>
The ex messaged Doolittle to “tell [her] friends to keep their mouths shut,” and although Doolittle agreed to talk to her friend about the situation, she made it clear there was no guarantee the postings would stop.
<br><Br>
 “’I’ll tell them,’” Doolittle says she told her ex, “’but that doesn’t mean they’re going to listen.’”
<br><Br>
Threatening messages from her ex then became a rant from her harasser.  Doolittle tried to reason with him but like her previous harasser, he verbally abused her and threatened her via Facebook Messenger with physical harm.
<br><Br>
“From then, he called me a whore, said I was nothing, that I better watch my back because he was going to come to my house.  He knew where I lived,” Doolittle says.
<Br><Br>
The online assault went on for hours.  Excerpts are below.

<p>
<br><Br>
Ignoring the messages didn’t make them stop, but neither did engaging with her harasser. Her school’s assigned police officer was notified and was instructed to watch for Doolittle’s ex on school property, but in the end that was not what finally ended her harassment.
<br><Br>
In fact, it just sort of subsided.  Doolittle says she believes her harasser eventually stopped because was never really going to hurt her.
<br><Br>
“He just wanted to be a bully to someone who was smaller than him.  That’s when I really realized he wasn’t going to do anything, he was just being asinine.”
<br><Br>
Luckily neither of Doolittle’s experiences with harassment amounted to any physical harm, they were jarring enough to make Doolittle think about who her friends are, online and in real life.
