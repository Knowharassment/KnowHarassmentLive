    <p>

Harassment, often of a sexual nature, is a civil offense, meaning perpetrators cannot be criminally charged and punished. Cyberharassment, or telecommunications harassment in many states, is a criminal offense, however, so people can bring legal charges against their harassers.
<br><Br>
See how many students at Kent State University, Akron University and Ohio State University reported telecommunications harassment to their university police departments from 2011 to 2013 here (link to statistics page).
<br><Br>
Jennifer O’Connell, sexual assault response coordinator at Sexual and Relationship Violence Support Services (SRVSS) at Kent State, said there may be more students reporting cyberharassment than face-to-face harassment or other sexual crimes because, if the victim saves the messages, they have physical proof.
<br><Br>
“In these cases, the victim might feel like their harasser would be more likely to be held accountable versus when it’s just verbal and you wonder, ‘Who’s going to believe me?’” O’Connell says.
<br><Br>
Historically, O’Connell says victims are often blamed for sexual crimes, which makes them less inclined to tell anyone. Victims of cyberharassment, however, can provide evidence to law enforcement instead of relying on a he said/she said scenario.
<br><Br>
Cyberharassment and cyberstalking laws are closely linked.
<br><Br>
Here is a look at cyberharassment laws, from federal to state to local, that dictate the way in which cyberharassment is defined and punished.
<br><Br>

<strong>The most widely cited definition of cyberharassment and cyberstalking as defined by <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/telecommunications-and-information-technology/cyberstalking-and-cyberharassment-laws.aspx">the National Conference of State Legislatures:</a></strong>
</p>
<br><Br>
        
<div id="subhead">Cyberharassment</div>
<p>Cyberharassment differs from cyberstalking in that it may generally be defined as not involving a credible threat. Cyberharassment usually pertains to threatening or harassing email messages, instant messages, or to blog entries or websites dedicated solely to tormenting an individual. Some states approach cyberharrassment by including language addressing electronic communications in general harassment statutes, while others have created stand-alone cyberharassment statutes.
</p>
<br><br>
    
<li>
<strong>Cyberstalking.</strong>Cyberstalking is the use of the Internet, email or other electronic communications to stalk, and generally refers to a pattern of threatening or malicious behaviors. Cyberstalking may be considered the most dangerous of the three types of Internet harassment, based on a posing credible threat of harm. Sanctions range from misdemeanors to felonies.
</li>
<br>

<i>The first legislation to include a cyber component to harassment passed in 1996.</i>
<br><Br>

<li><strong>Federal Legislation:</strong>
The Telecommunications Act of 1996, signed into law by the Clinton Administration, was the first overhaul of the The Telecommunications Act of 1934. 
<br>
The 1996 act amended Title 47 of the U.S. Code section 223 to outlaw use of a telecommunications device to annoy, abuse, threaten or harass. This includes comments or proposals that are obscene or indecent in nature. Those charged with telecommunications harassment under this legislation can face fines, imprisonment or both.
</li>
<br>
<br>
    
<li><strong>State Legislation in Ohio:</strong>
In Ohio, cyberharassment is referred to as “telecommunications harassment” in statutes. The terminology often varies by state. Title 29 of the Ohio Revised Code section 2917.21 outlines telecommunications harassment criteria. And section 2903.11 outlaws menacing by stalking, including a pertinent section about stalking by “electronic method.”
<Br>
Have you been a victim of “telecommunications harassment”? You could be if you’ve been:
<br>
Harassed or abused over the phone or on a “telecommunications device” such as a computer.
Received an electronic message that caused mental distress or lead to physical harm.
</li>
<br>
<Br>
    
<li><strong>Local Legislation in Kent, Ohio:</strong>
Even municipalities have enacted some protections for cyberharassment. In Kent, Ohio,
Part five, chapter five, section 537.10 of the Kent Codified Ordinances outlaws telecommunications harassment, which is a first-degree misdemeanor on the first offense and a felony on each subsequent offense.
</li>
<br>
<br>

<li><strong>Cyberharassment Law</strong>

The first specific cyberharassment law was signed into law Jan. 17, 2014 in New Jersey by Governor Chris Christie.
<br>
The law states a person is guilty of committing cyberharassment if “while online using any electronic device or a social networking site and with the purpose to harass another, that person threatens to injure or harm a person or that person’s property; knowingly sends, posts, comments, requests, suggests, or proposes lewd, indecent, or obscene material to or about a person with the intent to emotionally harm a reasonable person or place a reasonable person in fear of physical or emotional harm to his person; or threatens to commit a crime against a person or his or her property.”

<div id="sidebartext">

Sexual offenses can be confusing to discuss because of the uncomfortable nature ofthe topic, and because their classifications can be confusing. Sexual harassment and assault are serious issues in any community, but what some people may not know is that they are not both classified as crimes.
<br><Br>

A commonly used definition of sexual assault is “illegal sexual contact that usually involves force upon a person without consent or is inflicted upon a person who is incapable of giving consent (as because of age or physical or mental incapacity) or who places the assailant (as a doctor) in a position of trust or authority."
<br><Br>
Sexual harassment, on the other hand, is defined as such: “uninvited and unwelcome verbal or physical behavior of a sexual nature especially by a person in authority toward a subordinate (as an employee or student),”<sup><a href="http://www.merriamwebster.com/dictionary/sexual%20harassment"> (Merriam Webster).</a></sup> In other words, sexual harassment, while unwanted, is not illegal.
<br><br>
Of course sexual harassment and assault also have definitions pertaining to the online and mobile world; these are crimes like cyberstalking, child pornography, sexting, because many varieties of online crime are relatively new, many of them are not classified by governmental bodies as normal crimes would be.  For instance, physical sexual assault and harassment are under the very broad umbrella of “sexual offenses,” rather than 
being separated, though they are later categorized in the sentencing phase.
<br><Br>
        
Cyber sex offenses are classified the exact same way: very broadly, as sexual offenses.Sentences for cyber sex offenses – and physical sex offenses – are not always the same for each crime: the sentence is determined by the severity of the crime and the record of the accused, like every other case.
<br><Br>
        
Sentences for cyber offenses may change in the future as they become as standard, and possibly as frequent, as physical offenses of the same kind – and they might be well on their way to normalcy already.
<br><br>
        
Sexual offenses are not new crimes in Kent, and many students will say cyber sexual offenses are not new either, but what is new is how incidents of sexual crimes are being reported on and off campuses across the US.
<br><Br>
        
Incidents of sexual assault (physical and cyber) have increased in the past few years, but it may not be that more of the incidents are occurring, simply that more are being reported.Organizations and celebrities have taken to the airwaves and social media with intensified zeal in the recent past, trying to spread awareness about sexual violence, and encouraging victims to report instances of these crimes without hesitation.
<br><Br>
        
One might assume that these outreach efforts coupled with heightened security has also had a positive effect on making the number of reported incidents come closer to the number of crimes that have actually occurred.Although every city police department and campus police department is different, the reporting procedures for these crimes, physical or cyber, tend to be similar.
<br><Br>
        
Officer Penn of the Kent State University Police Department says to report an instance of sexual assault, cyber or otherwise, all one has to do is call the police station.  
<br><Br>
        
Information about the incident can be reported over the phone, although Penn recommends giving a statement in person.  According to Penn, an officer can be dispatched to the location of the caller to take the statement, or the caller can come to the station.  
<br><br>
        
    Penn also advises that incidents be reported as quickly as possible in order to collect as much evidence as possible, and so that the statement can be taken while details are still easily remembered.
