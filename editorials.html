            <h2>The Rise of Cyberharassment</h2>
            <h4>by Christina Bucciere</h4>
            <p style="font-size:.8em;">Published: 11/3/14 9:00am</p>
    
		<p>As Joelle Ligon attempted to lead a normal life, taking new job opportunities in different states, Robert James Murphy was always there—not physically, but electronically.</p>
        <p>
In April 2004, Robert James Murphy of Columbia, S.C. was charged with “26 counts of using his computer ‘to annoy, abuse, threaten and harass’ Joelle Ligon, 35, of Seattle,” according to a <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fusatoday30.usatoday.com%2Ftech%2Fnews%2Ftechpolicy%2F2004-04-23-cyberstalking-inocent-plea_x.htm&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGLKbMgiOCde3ZUUD-ex2WpiC8BDw">2004 USA Today article.</a>
            </p><p>
 
Murphy was the first person to face charges under <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Ftransition.fcc.gov%2FReports%2Ftcom1996.pdf&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEmvyBIcytvcPJEMzPhPqaQmZXZyA">The Telecommunications Act of 1996</a> that amended <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.law.cornell.edu%2Fuscode%2Ftext%2F47%2F223&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEhuM83K5rEG2UXml6N7oKty1Z6iQ">Title 47 of the U.S. Code section 223</a> to outlaw the use of a telecommunications device with the intent to annoy, abuse, threaten or harass.
 </p><p>
Murphy and Ligon dated in Salt Lake City when Ligon was 15, and the couple broke up when she was 22. Murphy began sending obscene and sexually explicit messages to her in 1998, even tracking her from his computer as she changed jobs and moved to different states.
 </p><p>
Ligon said she deleted and ignored the messages for four years. Then, she began saving them as evidence and approached police. 
 </p><p>
In October of 2004, Murphy pleaded guilty to two counts of cyberstalking and was sentenced to “five years of probation, 500 hours of community service and more than $12,000 in restitution,” according to follow-up <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fusatoday30.usatoday.com%2Ftech%2Fnews%2Finternetprivacy%2F2004-10-29-net-stalker-chided_x.htm&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHRFksfCsv8dCha6kdlyPM7XMh1rQ">reporting</a> by USA Today.
 </p><p>
Murphy’s case set the first precedent for legal repercussions regarding cyberharassment and cyberstalking. 
</p><p>
Much has changed since the early 2000s, and the number of victims is growing.
</p><p>
According to <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bjs.gov%2Fcontent%2Fpub%2Fpdf%2Fsvus_rev.pdf&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEEpQDhq0iJbSqGEkwkLk0kv1kyZQ">“Stalking Victims in the United States--Revised”</a>, a special reported released by the Department of Justice in September 2012, an estimated 3.3 million people aged 18 or older were victims of stalking during a 12-month period. 
</p><p>
The report’s data comes from the Supplemental Victimization Survey. Nearly 64 percent of survey respondents said the nature of stalking or harassment came in the form of unwanted phone calls and messages. 
</p><p>
About 58 percent of those respondents reported being harassed, and 67 percent of them said they were stalked. Respondents were allowed to choose multiple responses.
</p>
<h4 style="margin-top:2em;">Changing Communication</h4>
<p>
In 2014, the way people spend their time has changed, which means the way people are harassed has changed, too.
</p><p>
According to a Nielsen <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nielsen.com%2Fcontent%2Fcorporate%2Fus%2Fen%2Finsights%2Fnews%2F2014%2Fhow-smartphones-are-changing-consumers-daily-routines-around-the-globe.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFWN18Iwi5QTI0ObI67nMaFGrZoxA">survey</a>, on average, people spend about 27 hours per month online and about 34 hours per month on a mobile device.
</p><p><p>
And according to the Pew Internet Project’s 2012 <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pewinternet.org%2F2012%2F11%2F30%2Fthe-best-and-worst-of-mobile-connectivity%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEuN2Wxe5rmZUk1GtJmWld29zReFw">report</a> on mobile technology, 44 percent of cell owners have slept with their phone next to their bed to make sure they didn’t miss any notifications.
</p><p>
Just as potential victims are spending more and more time on mobile devices, harassers are spending more time on them, too.
</p><p>
Danielle Citron, law professor at the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law, wrote in her book <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hup.harvard.edu%2Fcatalog.php%3Fisbn%3D9780674368293&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNG8uoyCWOkYVzmsyx2XYm0Pf010Lg">“Hate Crimes in Cyberspace”</a> that some researchers show 30 to 40 percent of Internet users will face some form of cyberharssment in their lifetime.
</p><p>
“Real-space stalking with no online component is more prevalent than stalking online with or without a physical component, but that may soon change,” Citron wrote. “Cyber stalking victimization strongly correlates with time spent online—especially for young people who are online for hours a day.”
</p><p>
Jayne Hitchcock, president of WHO, Working to <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.haltabuse.org%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEmvGYPCMw5OhdJrMVW9TtvDmOZzQ">Halt Online Abuse</a>, a volunteer organization that attempts to educate the public about online abuse and help victims of cyberharassment, said the prevalence of cyberharassment warps people’s perceptions of its severity.
</p><p>
“I feel people shrug it off, hoping it will go away or that no one will take them seriously,” Hitchcock said. “But, if they do not do something about it, it could escalate or that person will target someone else and continue the harassment or stalking.”
</p><p>
The rise of cyberharassment was aided by the ease with which harassers were able to target their victim and cause longer-lasting harm.
</p><p>
“The Internet extends the life of destructive posts. Harassing letters are eventually thrown away, and memories fade in time. The web, however, can make it impossible to forget about malicious posts. Search engines index content on the web and produce it instantaneously. Indexed posts have no built-in expiration date; neither does the suffering they cause,” Citron writes.
Jennifer O’Connell, sexual assault response coordinator at Sexual and Relationship Violence Support Services (SRVSS) at Kent State, said the Internet makes it easier for harassers not only because of the tools available, but also because of the “feeling of anonymity.”

</p><p>
“Electronics or the Internet sometimes makes it easier because you don’t have to put a face with it and you can just blindly write something or you don’t have to have that reaction right in front of you,” O’Connell said. “If you were face-to-face with someone, some people wouldn’t say what they said online.”
</p><p>
The term cyberharassment casts a wide net, encompassing a wide range of behaviors and motivations ranging from spiteful ex-partners seeking revenge, enemies threatening violence, or pervasive, unwanted attention, sexual or not, from acquaintances. The source of the harassment can be known or unknown. 
</p><p>
In some cases, cyberharassment has been dubbed “trolling,” described by an <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Ftechnology%2Farchive%2F2012%2F10%2Fwhat-an-academic-who-wrote-her-dissertation-on-trolls-thinks-of-violentacrez%2F263631%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHVAQVOZpL0lW03-FVe6JIuDdSklg">Atlantic Magazine article</a> as “everything from harmless, and perhaps even helpful, mischief to defamation to watching leaked crime scene videos to outright harassment (sometimes described as "cyberbullying"), either of someone known to the troll or high-profile public figures.” 
</p><p>
While cyberharassment has begun to take on its own identity, O’Connell argues it stems from the same behaviors that have always spurred unwanted attention and harassing behaviors. 
</p><p>
“People are experiencing comments that are sexual in nature or comments that make someone uncomfortable regularly,” O’Connell said. “It might not be classified as harassment at that point, but those are the behaviors that, when gone unchecked, nobody will know that that’s not OK. Those behaviors can then continue, and then it starts to turn into that more pervasive, creating that hostile environment, harassment. You get those minor things that oftentimes people overlook or shrug off, and then over time they can be a bigger problem.”</p>
