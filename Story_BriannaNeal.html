<p>Brianna Neal’s stomach drops every time she receives a call from a restricted number.
<br><br>
Even when the number is simply not in her phone book, not restricted, Neal becomes sick with worry.
<Br><br>
Neal, senior photojournalism major, has been cyberharassed since summer 2011 by a man she dated briefly before attending Kent State. Now, she is ready to explore the ways she can put an end to the situation.
<br><br>
During a night out after high school graduation in, Neal met a man at a bar, and the two exchanged numbers.
<br><br>
Neal says she saw her harasser about 10 times before ending contact with him in December 2011 to focus on her freshman year at Kent State.
<br><br>
Neal’s harasser went to prison for nearly two years for unrelated charges, and in June 2013, Neal says she started receiving restricted calls on her cell phone.
<br><br>
No one ever spoke on the other end.
<br><br>
“There were days when I would get three or four in a row,” Neal says. “I didn’t put two and two together until the middle of the summer when it became excessive. Then, it was so excessive that I changed my number.”
<br><br>
Once Neal realized who was making the calls, she blocked the man on Facebook, but the harasser found other ways to contact her.
<br><br>
Neal has received emails to her business account, messages to her professional photography Facebook page and messages through old high school friends’ Facebook accounts. 
<br><br>
It’s this pattern of behavior that qualifies Neal’s situation as cyberharassment, says Community Resource Officer Michquel Penn of the Kent State Police Department.
<br><br>
“There’s no set number of texts, emails or calls you have to receive to have a case of cyberharassment,” Penn says. “There’s no formula. It’s all about the incessant pattern of behavior.”
<br><br>
Neal has since blocked the harasser on all private social media accounts and asked her friends to block him as well.
<br><br>
But about one week ago, Neal says the harasser found her public Instagram account and left a comment. 
<br><br>
“That was my final straw,” Neal says.
<br><br>
The content of the messages has never been threatening, Neal says. They feel more like a call for attention.
<br><br>
“He always asks, ‘Why do you hate me?’ ” Neal says. “It seems like he just wants acknowledging, and I haven’t yet. Part of me wants to to see if he stops, but I fear for my safety.”
<br><br>
Because of that fear, and the way she reacts to the harassers messages, Neal says she started seeing a psychologist to talk about her feelings.
<br><br>
“Every time he contacts me I feel sick, I cry instantly, I fear for my safety,” Neal says. “I notice there’s certain triggers. Anytime I receive a restricted call I freak out, even a call from a number I don’t have in my phone. I get really nervous. I never answer it. I don’t want to live like this. It’s not fair to me. I feel like it’s holding me back.”
<br><br>
Neal says she is mostly worried about the lengths the harasser will go to try to contact her because she “doesn’t know what jail does to people,” and she is scared, no matter how many ways she finds to block the harasser from contacting her, he will always find a way.
<br><br>
“I think it’s impossible to completely hide from someone these days,” Neal says. “He’s going to find me. I hope I can get away from him, but I doubt that’s going to happen.”
<br><br>
Now that Neal has started the process of facing the emotional impact the cyberharassment has caused, she is ready to start looking into legal repercussions to control the harassers ability to make contact. That being said, Neal is unsure of where to start.
<br><br>
Neal started recording the dates and times of each restricted call once she realized it might be the harasser has taken screenshots of each social media message in case one day she decided to take legal action and pursue a charge or restraining order.
<br><br>
But Neal says she doesn’t have faith in the court system.
<br><br>
“I feels like the courts won’t do anything,” Neal says. “I don’t know if a restraining order will help with this, and it’s kind of discouraging.”
<br><br>
Neal says she thinks she feels that way about the court’s inability to make a difference in her situation because she’s never heard of a cyberharassment indictment or lawsuit, let alone a successful one.
Yet, the lack of cyberharassment conversation runs contrary to cyberharassment’s prevalence, Neal says.
<br><br>
“It’ more common than we choose to think it is,” Neal says. “I think maybe that’s because we don’t think it’s a big threat. A lot of my friends have gotten unwanted messages. You don’t think of social media as a place to be stalked or harassed.”
<br><br>
And sometimes it’s difficult to tell whether a situation is potentially dangerous or has reached a pervasive, harassing level, Penn says. 
<br><br>
“Sometimes you’re not sure,” Penn says. “It may take getting somebody else’s opinion, or maybe you kind of have a feeling or a hunch that it seems a little strange. But if you’re just not sure, or you don’t want to ask a friend, you can always ask the police.”

         If you’re being cyberharassed, follow these steps.
        </div>
    
    <div id="sidebartext">
<ol>
    <li>Clearly tell the harasser to stop. Then, do not respond to any further messages.
    </li>
    
    <li>Save every form of communication sent to you by the harasser to use as evidence later.
    </li>
    
    <li>Complain to the appropriate parties. For example, if you are being harassed on an instant messaging system, read the terms of service and harassment policies and use the contact information provided.
    </li>
    
    <li>Determine your desired result. Think about what you want to happen in your best-case scenario; it will be different for everyone.
